## AB Note -- previous versions of this code used life tables; after talking to Alexis I don't think this is
## the way we want to go. The forecast book explains life tables on page 55, but the general idea is that
## when we calculate things like life expectancy we can't just assume that everyone dies at the end of the period
## and need to account for the denominator shifting as people die

## we aren't projecting life expectancy or measuring years lived or anything, so we don't need them
## we are just interested in "how many people die between t0 and t1" and not interested in when they died within the period

## the overall impact is that the survival rates are slightly lower as people no longer get credit for
## surviving partway through the interval

## more details on life tables can be found in the forecast book starting on page 55
