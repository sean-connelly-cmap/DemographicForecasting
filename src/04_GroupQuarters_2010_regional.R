# This script fetches detailed 2010 Group Quarters populations and calculates ratios of
# GQ type to Pop for each Age group and Sex by Region (with the exception of Military).

# we are basically trying to determine GQ counts for the period we have birth data (2014-2018)
# the issue is the 2014-2018 population estimates from the Census do not split out the GQ population
# however, the 2010 and 2020 Census do have group quarters estimates
# this script assumes the GQ proportions (or, in the case of military, absolute counts) are the same
# in 2014-2018 as they were in 2010. There is an argument we should be using 2020, but I think 2020 is better
# COVID causes general issues with the Census and the Census basically admitted they miscounted GQ in Illinois in 2020
