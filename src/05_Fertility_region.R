# calc female HOUSEHOULD pop ----------------------------

## Step 1: Calculate 2010 GQ totals by County, excluding military ------
gq_totals_2010 <- gq %>%
  filter(category == 'County Total',
         concept != 'GROUP QUARTERS POPULATION IN MILITARY QUARTERS BY SEX BY AGE') %>%
  group_by(geoid, county) %>%
  summarise(county_gq_total = sum(value), .groups = "drop") %>%
  select(geoid, county, county_gq_total)

## Step 2: Calculate 2010 Female GQ totals by County, Sex, Age, excluding military ------
female_gq_2010 <- gq %>%
  filter(sex == 'Female',
         concept != 'GROUP QUARTERS POPULATION IN MILITARY QUARTERS BY SEX BY AGE',
         age %in% F_Groups) %>%
  group_by(geoid, age, region) %>% #region is redundant here but keeping for later use
  summarise(female_gq = sum(value), .groups = "drop")

## Step 3: For each GQ female age group of interest, calculate what proportion of each county's total 2010 GQ population they represent ------
gq_2010 <- female_gq_2010 |>
  left_join(gq_totals_2010) %>%
  mutate(prop_female = female_gq/county_gq_total)

## Step 4: Read in GQ Census estimates by State, County for 2011-2019 -----

#data downloaded from this page: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html
#table: Population, Population Change, and Estimated Components of Population Change: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (CO-EST2019-alldata) [<1.0 MB]

#for 2020 onwards you can now access this via the get_estimates() command

gq_pep <- read_csv("Input/co-est2019-alldata.csv")

gq_proc <- gq_pep |>
  mutate(geoid = str_c(STATE,COUNTY)) |>
  filter(geoid %in% setdiff(unlist(cmapgeo::county_fips_codes), c("18073","18111"))) |>  #MSA includes two extra IN counties
  select(geoid, setdiff(starts_with("GQ"), ends_with("2010"))) |> #dont need 2010 since we have Census counts
  pivot_longer(cols = GQESTIMATES2011:GQESTIMATES2019, names_to = c("year")) |>
  mutate(year = parse_number(year)) |>
  rename(population = value) |>
  distinct()

## Step 5: Multiply 2010 proportions by 2011-2019 GQ estimates to get expected number of females ----
gqe_project <- gq_2010 |>
  left_join(gq_proc, by = "geoid") %>%
  mutate(gqe_pred = round(prop_female*population,0)) %>%
  select(geoid, age, gqe_pred, year, region) #region redundant but used later

## Step 6: Female TOTAL population estimates by County, Age and Sex for 2011-2019 ----
yearly_total_pop <- tibble()
for (YEAR in GQE_YEARS) {

  pop_est <- POP[[as.character(YEAR)]] %>%
    filter(sex == 'Female')  %>%
    filter(age %in% F_Groups) %>%
    group_by(geoid, year, age) %>%
    summarise(county_total = sum(population), .groups = "drop") |>
    select(geoid, year, age, county_total)

  yearly_total_pop <- bind_rows(yearly_total_pop, pop_est)
  rm(pop_est)
}

# lengths(lapply(yearly_total_pop, unique)) # quick check

## Step 7: For 2011-2019 subtract expected GQ population from county Total to get County HH populations -----
hh_population <- gqe_project |>
  left_join(yearly_total_pop) %>%
  mutate(hh_pop = county_total - gqe_pred) %>%
  select(geoid, age, hh_pop, year, region) #region redundant but used later


#the last version of this implied that the Census data was household counts (i.e. excluded GQ) but the Census variable used (P0120)
#clearly include GQ (universe = "total population") -- https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/C2010/metadata/?ds=SF1&table=P0120

## Step 8: Filter 2010 Decennial Census HH Data for females 15-44 -----
female_hh_2010 <- POP[["2010"]]  %>%
    filter(sex == 'Female') %>%
    filter(age %in% F_Groups) |>
    clean_names()  |>
    left_join(female_gq_2010) |>  #from Step 2
    mutate(hh_pop = population - female_gq) |>
    select(geoid, age, hh_pop, year, region)

## Step 9: Merge 2010 Census HH Population data and 2011-2019 HH Population Estimates to form a complete table of Household Population data -----
f_hh_data <- rbind(female_hh_2010, hh_population)

## Census ASFR Projections ----------------------------------------------

#   Note: could try using the package censusapi to import directly

  clean_names()

#General Note/ explanation for change in the code:
  # the "Births" file takes all births for women 45-49 years and assigns them to the 40-44 group
  # the "f_hh_data" file, the births denominator, does not include 45-49 year old women in the denominator
        # the overall effect of this as I reason it out depends on the relative sizes of each cohort
        # if we assume that:
                  #1. the birthrate for 45-50 is lower than 40-44 (almost certaintly true)
                  #2. the 45-50 has fewer people than 40-44 (less positive but generally true in data)
          # there are two implications if both are true
              # the calculated birthrate for the 40-44 group will result in the correct number of births, since the numerator ASFR ends up being larger than true but the denominator is smaller than true (since we only include the hh_pop for 40-44)
              # if we simply add the birth rates of the 45-50 group to the 40-44 group, we get an ASFR that is too high (since we are only adjusting the numerator up)

  #this was all a way of thinking ou that I think we should only include the Census age ranges for the actual age group (40-45) and not tack on the older ASFRs
  #if we simply add them the calculated ASFRs would be too high

 #see sandbox/asfr_test.xlsx for example
